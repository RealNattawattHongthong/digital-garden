# **How to Take Notes Quickly**
1. Please Do not taking notes in paper. It is slow and inefficient. Use digital notes instead like typing on your laptop or phone.
2. Try to use a note-taking app that supports markdown. It is easy to use and can be converted to other formats easily. Like Obsidian
3. Use a template for your notes. It will help you to organize your notes better and faster.
for me I use this template:
```markdown
---
Title: Lecture Title (optional)
Date: 2024-04-21
Tags: #lecture #notes
---
# Lecture Title
## Introduction
## Main Content
## Conclusion
```
And yeah, that's it. You can take notes faster and more efficiently now. Maybe?
